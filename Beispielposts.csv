"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

August 2024 Trump - 130 million
August 2024 Harris - 361 million

September 2020 Trump - 248 million
September 2024 Trump - 160 million

"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s. 

(rest of photos will be in comments.)"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"

"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"

"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?
"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials? 

Can they form a coalition to move the country forward? Or are their politics so different that a coalition is unlikely? 

In summary, how does one generation change or influence the future politics in America? 

"
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

August 2024 Trump - 130 million
August 2024 Harris - 361 million

September 2020 Trump - 248 million
September 2024 Trump - 160 million

"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

[https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-politics-policy-spring-2024/toc/4/](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-politics-policy-spring-2024/toc/4/)

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials? 

Can they form a coalition to move the country forward? Or are their politics so different that a coalition is unlikely? 

In summary, how does one generation change or influence the future politics in America? 

"
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"God bless Scott Pressler... YouTuber Eli Yoder (formerly Amish) claims that close to 200,000 Amish  registrations so far across the US. "
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Article on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html"
Color me surprised... 
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"A waitress, a mechanic and a Nascar driver running for US Congress"
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials?

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet?

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well.

In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better.

Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

At the DNC, speaker after speaker asked for individual Democrats to pitch in to help win in November. What do you think individuals should do to help Kamala and other Democrats win?"
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"

"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States.

Wow…
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

Policy positions were summarized from these campaign speeches:

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.  
  
"
Wow…
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
He’s the best of the silent generation and probably my best friend on earth- lucky to have been raised by a guy like him!
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s. 

(rest of photos will be in comments.)"
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
Wow…
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "

"Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-army-defends-arlington-national-cemetery-employee-trump-campaign-incident-2024-08-29/

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

3.) [JD Vance has outright stated Kamala can ""go to hell"" in response to Kamala's criticism of the Arlington National Cemetery incident.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/-can-go-hell-vance-blasts-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal-harshest-rheto-rcna168691)

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials?

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else.

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous.

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security.

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
Color me surprised... 
Wow…
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s. 

(rest of photos will be in comments.)"
That’s all. 
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

Policy positions were summarized from these campaign speeches:

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"A waitress, a mechanic and a Nascar driver running for US Congress"
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials? 

Can they form a coalition to move the country forward? Or are their politics so different that a coalition is unlikely? 

In summary, how does one generation change or influence the future politics in America?

"A waitress, a mechanic and a Nascar driver running for US Congress"
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
That’s all. 
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the

"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Article on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html"
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
Wow…
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials? 

Can they form a coalition to move the country forward? Or are their politics so different that a coalition is unlikely? 

In summary, how does one generation change or influence the future politics in America?

"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right.

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary. 
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"

Color me surprised... 
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
When desperation strikes
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
That’s all. 
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else.

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous.

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

""The last four years the region has gone into a very difficult direction,"" he said. ""Food inflation is really high. Organized crime and violence are really high. And, you know, little by little, they're losing their democratic practices. There's a huge democratic backsliding happening in the region."""
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump.

"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary.

"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"

I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better.

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it.

"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"

The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map? 

"
"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire.

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"

I know nothing about P-2025
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary.

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala.

Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better.

	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years.

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates

of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”

"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."

In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers.

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "

"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

When desperation strikes
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"“Consider this to be your official ask. Michelle Obama is asking you — no, I’m telling y’all — to do something.” — Michelle Obama

At the DNC, speaker after speaker asked for individual Democrats to pitch in to help win in November. What do you think individuals should do to help Kamala and other Democrats win?"
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess.

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"God bless Scott Pressler... YouTuber Eli Yoder (formerly Amish) claims that close to 200,000 Amish  registrations so far across the US. "
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"BREAKING: Here are the 14 Republicans that voted “NO”:

Banks-IN
Biggs-AZ
Boebert-CO
Burchett-TN
Crane-AZ
Gaetz-FL
Hunt-TX
Lamborn-CO
Mace-SC
Mills-FL
Rogers-AL

Steube-FL
Van Duyne-TX"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "

"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials? 

Can they form a coalition to move the country forward? Or are their politics so different that a coalition is unlikely? 

In summary, how does one generation change or influence the future politics in America? 

"
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"Link to article on the vote today:

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work.

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did.

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala.

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Article on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

**Edit: Second debate discussion thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdy9k3/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
Color me surprised... 
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-army-defends-arlington-national-cemetery-employee-trump-campaign-incident-2024-08-29/

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

3.) [JD Vance has outright stated Kamala can ""go to hell"" in response to Kamala's criticism of the Arlington National Cemetery incident.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/-can-go-hell-vance-blasts-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal-harshest-rheto-rcna168691)

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"

it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
That’s all. 
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election? 

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials? 

Can they form a coalition to move the country forward? Or are their politics so different that a coalition is unlikely? 

In summary, how does one generation change or influence the future politics in America? 

"
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"

"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s. 

(rest of photos will be in comments.)"
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet?

"Tonight's debate is being hosted on ABC in the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, and will be moderated by anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis.  It is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes.  The candidates' microphones will, under rules negotiated between the Biden and Trump campaigns, be muted in the absence of ""significant crosstalk"".  The [full rules for tonight's debate can be found here on ABC's site](https://abc.com/news/5e38600c-4732-4cd2-a99c-3dedfa81beb0/category/1138628).  Per [a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5106660/election-poll-harris-trump-debate), ""Seven-in-10 Americans say they are going to watch the first presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and 3-in-10 say it will help decide their vote"".

Tonight's debate is the only remaining presidential-level debate scheduled for this cycle; the Vice Presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio senator J.D. Vance is scheduled for October 1st.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it.

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
Wow…
Color me surprised... 
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."

"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

"Support Josh Hawley

https://joshhawley.com"
"
according to estimations, almost 10 million baby boomers/silent generation people have died since 2020. (2.4 million boomers have died per year since 2020)

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/older-american-health.htm

And they are the most conservative voter groups. 

according to pew research (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/)

Do you think this have a effect on the 2024 presidential election? And how much? "
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different.

In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Article on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html"
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."

"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."

"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

August 2024 Trump - 130 million
August 2024 Harris - 361 million

September 2020 Trump - 248 million
September 2024 Trump - 160 million

"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"Support Josh Hawley

https://joshhawley.com"
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
That’s all. 
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map? 

"
"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

""The last four years the region has gone into a very difficult direction,"" he said. ""Food inflation is really high. Organized crime and violence are really high. And, you know, little by little, they're losing their democratic practices. There's a huge democratic backsliding happening in the region."""
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
When desperation strikes
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row.

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala.

"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "

"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!!

"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers.

"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
That’s all. 
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"Do they recognize their political power? If they do and vote will it shift the election?

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago?

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot.

"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing:

""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners).

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play?

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"

With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery.

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do.

Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map? 

"
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.

My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election?

Wow…
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.  

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?  

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work.

Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary. 
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

"Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-army-defends-arlington-national-cemetery-employee-trump-campaign-incident-2024-08-29/

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

3.) [JD Vance has outright stated Kamala can ""go to hell"" in response to Kamala's criticism of the Arlington National Cemetery incident.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/-can-go-hell-vance-blasts-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal-harshest-rheto-rcna168691)

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
That’s all. 
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s. 

(rest of photos will be in comments.)"
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes.

I know nothing about P-2025
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers.

"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?
"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"

The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
That’s all. 
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.  

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?  

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
He’s the best of the silent generation and probably my best friend on earth- lucky to have been raised by a guy like him!
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election.

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate.

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

Policy positions were summarized from these campaign speeches:

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

August 2024 Trump - 130 million
August 2024 Harris - 361 million

September 2020 Trump - 248 million

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"

"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

**Edit: Second debate discussion thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdy9k3/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence.

"A waitress, a mechanic and a Nascar driver running for US Congress"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.  

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?  

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
When desperation strikes
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.  
  
"
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
He’s the best of the silent generation and probably my best friend on earth- lucky to have been raised by a guy like him!
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

[NPR source.](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris)"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary. 
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose?

Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess.

"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
Color me surprised... 
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

Wow…
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
That’s all. 
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary.

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it.

Wow…
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"

"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
That’s all. 
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.

"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
Wow…
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars.

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Article on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.

Wow…
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
When desperation strikes
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
Color me surprised...

"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"

"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

Policy positions were summarized from these campaign speeches:

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.  
  
"
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"

"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.  

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"

"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
That’s all. 
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."

"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”

"A waitress, a mechanic and a Nascar driver running for US Congress"
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."

"“Consider this to be your official ask. Michelle Obama is asking you — no, I’m telling y’all — to do something.” — Michelle Obama

At the DNC, speaker after speaker asked for individual Democrats to pitch in to help win in November. What do you think individuals should do to help Kamala and other Democrats win?"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "

"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."

I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?


[Washington Post source.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/)

"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"

At the DNC, speaker after speaker asked for individual Democrats to pitch in to help win in November. What do you think individuals should do to help Kamala and other Democrats win?"
"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"

"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.

"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"

"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
Color me surprised... 
When desperation strikes
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary. 
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"

"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Article on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html"
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary.

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"

"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"

At the DNC, speaker after speaker asked for individual Democrats to pitch in to help win in November. What do you think individuals should do to help Kamala and other Democrats win?"

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
https://news.bitcoin.com/polymarket-election-buzz-why-trumps-lead-is-stirring-skeptics-and-memes-alike/
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"

"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
I know nothing about P-2025
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

**Edit: Second debate discussion thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdy9k3/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"
He’s the best of the silent generation and probably my best friend on earth- lucky to have been raised by a guy like him!
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s. 

(rest of photos will be in comments.)"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
"
according to estimations, almost 10 million baby boomers/silent generation people have died since 2020. (2.4 million boomers have died per year since 2020)

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/older-american-health.htm

And they are the most conservative voter groups. 

according to pew research (https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/)

Do you think this have a effect on the 2024 presidential election? And how much? "
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"

When desperation strikes
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
Color me surprised...

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.  

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?  

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

""The last four years the region has gone into a very difficult direction,"" he said. ""Food inflation is really high. Organized crime and violence are really high. And, you know, little by little, they're losing their democratic practices. There's a huge democratic backsliding happening in the region."""
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"

"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

Policy positions were summarized from these campaign speeches:

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.  
  
"
With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future

Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

Do you think this have a effect on the 2024 presidential election? And how much? "
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

<<<<About four in ten registered voters (39%) say global warming will be “very important” to their vote in the 2024 presidential election, making it the 19^(th) most highly ranked issue of the 28 issues asked about (refer to data tables, pp. 38-47).>>

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary. 
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

**Edit: Second debate discussion thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdy9k3/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is a democrat going to win a senate race in TX?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

Is a democrat going to win the governor race of a guaranteed red state?

Any unexpected outcome that might happen somewhere? "

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
When desperation strikes
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote!

Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump.

"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
The mainstream media is the enemy of the people.
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President.

While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
I know nothing about P-2025
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"We just can't get a break from the news. It's also the anticipation that I don't like, since apparently it may be a tight race. 

EDIT: (I voted yesterday)"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"

it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"Like the title states, what do you think is going to be an unexpected result of this election. Lets ignore who's going to be the overall presidential winner, rather focus on a specific state if you think so.

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

"“Consider this to be your official ask. Michelle Obama is asking you — no, I’m telling y’all — to do something.” — Michelle Obama

At the DNC, speaker after speaker asked for individual Democrats to pitch in to help win in November. What do you think individuals should do to help Kamala and other Democrats win?"
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
Ok I wasn’t really paying attention earlier and made mistakes but this is my actual prediction.
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system.

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
That’s all. 
"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

August 2024 Trump - 130 million
August 2024 Harris - 361 million

September 2020 Trump - 248 million
September 2024 Trump - 160 million

Sources: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/02/trump-fundraising-september-2024-00182263"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"A waitress, a mechanic and a Nascar driver running for US Congress"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map? 

"
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

3.) [JD Vance has outright stated Kamala can ""go to hell"" in response to Kamala's criticism of the Arlington National Cemetery incident.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/-can-go-hell-vance-blasts-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal-harshest-rheto-rcna168691)

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence.

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."
"Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. 

Making the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.

But from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.

What would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation? "

**Edit: thread 4: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fdyytn/discussion_thread_first_presidential_debate_of/?sort=new**"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary. 
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
That’s all. 
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset.

"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
Yes our state is definitely going blue but I would crawl through miles of broken glass to vote for Kamala and against the orange monster.  
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"
"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

"The development, which is a huge win for Republicans, is expected to impact thousands of votes in November.

The PA Supreme Court vacated a Commonwealth Court ruling, saying they ""lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter.""

""The Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the matter given the failure to name the county boards of elections of all 67 counties,"" the court wrote.

""This is a huge win to protect the vote in Pennsylvania that will protect commonsense mail ballot safeguards and help voters cast their ballots with confidence. The Keystone State will be absolutely critical in this election, and the Supreme Court has decided a major victory for election integrity,"" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said."
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
I sincerely hope we have the guts to employ military if and when necessary.

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

When desperation strikes
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."

"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map?

"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused. Go out and vote!"
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.  
  
"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?
"
"Looks like a truck ran over it. Someone had already stomped it last week but I was able to bend it back.

I will be relieved when this election is over!

And for those that say I brought this on myself, yes, I did. I felt I needed to make a statement as a blue dot. "
"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"Biden was just a regular citizen with no access to any government powers. 

"
"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Link to his words on it:

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

""The last four years the region has gone into a very difficult direction,"" he said. ""Food inflation is really high. Organized crime and violence are really high. And, you know, little by little, they're losing their democratic practices. There's a huge democratic backsliding happening in the region."""
"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "

"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?
"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.

With the most recent debate out there there are a number of policy positions that have either been clarified or expanded upon. What issues are the most important to you? Do you have a solution that is most ideal or are you looking for a candidate that will provide a solution? Are there any issues that you care about that haven’t made it to the national stage yet? 
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"

"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements.

"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans?

"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

"
"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"

Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote!

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

"I've been following the fundraising numbers for the 2024 election cycle, and something stands out: Democrats are outraising Republicans by a noticeable margin. What's more, Republicans seem to be bringing in less money than they did during the last election cycle.

August 2024 Trump - 130 million
August 2024 Harris - 361 million

September 2020 Trump - 248 million
September 2024 Trump - 160 million

"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

""The last four years the region has gone into a very difficult direction,"" he said. ""Food inflation is really high. Organized crime and violence are really high. And, you know, little by little, they're losing their democratic practices. There's a huge democratic backsliding happening in the region."""
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"
"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

Longtime Dem voter here, but this is my first season volunteering, and it's been pretty disheartening. And I didn't even get into the Trump supporters I've talked to that are fully disconnected from reality and civility... "
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"BREAKING: Here are the 14 Republicans that voted “NO”:

Banks-IN

"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!  
If Joe Biden (had pass*d away) I’d get it, but this seems absurd and I don’t understand why democrats weren’t furious.

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

But will they happen? His promises and potential policies examined here: [https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv](https://www.thetimes.com/world/us-world/article/what-if-donald-trump-wins-election-president-2024-xvc2qc0bv)

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."

"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"God bless Scott Pressler... YouTuber Eli Yoder (formerly Amish) claims that close to 200,000 Amish  registrations so far across the US. "
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"So there have been rumours about Trump and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer having an affair or at least a very close relationship. There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? 

2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)"

I rarely see climate change discussed in depth by candidates, on cable news networks, on network Sunday morning talk shows, etc., and often not even mentioned superficially as a major campaign issue in 2024."

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"Joseph Humire, an expert on Latin America and executive director of the think tank Center for a Secure Society, told Fox News Digital that many Latin Americans hope for a Trump victory on Nov. 5.


Humire said the Biden administration's policy toward Latin America has resulted in it being ""the worst that I’ve seen.""

""The last four years the region has gone into a very difficult direction,"" he said. ""Food inflation is really high. Organized crime and violence are really high.

"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "

"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."
"BREAKING: Here are the 14 Republicans that voted “NO”:

Banks-IN
Biggs-AZ
Boebert-CO
Burchett-TN
Crane-AZ
Gaetz-FL
Hunt-TX
Lamborn-CO
Mace-SC

"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?


[Washington Post source.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/)

[NPR source.](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris)"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years.

This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"
With early voting already underway, shouldn’t that have already happened or happen this week at the latest? For either candidate

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"

"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"

So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years.

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates

of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump.

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US

With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump.

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?  

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "
"It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."

"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
"Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally. While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

N.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to ""his supporters"" or ""his supporter's"", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning."

Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
it’s going to be insane.be mentally prepare when the other side wins.
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.

He’s the best of the silent generation and probably my best friend on earth- lucky to have been raised by a guy like him!
"Greetings and welcome to the first debate. I know everybody is extremely excited, so I'm gonna put together a thread!

Remember, be polite and civil. No personal attacks towards each other, period.

Due to the nature of the debate, expect heavy trolling tonight."
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"I see pundits occasionally refer to the fact that, despite Clinton leading in the polls, there were signs later on in the election season that she was on track to do poorly. Low voter enthusiasm, high number of undecideds, results in certain primaries, etc. But I also remember there being plenty of fanfare about early vote numbers and ballot returns showing positive signs that never materialized. In your opinion, what are some relevant warning signs that we saw in 2016, and are these factors any different for Harris this election?"
"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"

"God bless Scott Pressler... YouTuber Eli Yoder (formerly Amish) claims that close to 200,000 Amish  registrations so far across the US. "
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"In 2020 I didn't pay much attention to the election; I was stressed about it so I did my part as a citizen and voted, but at no point was I invested in checking the polls or watching the debates or keeping up in general.

I was looking today at some of the historical polling from 2020 and it seems like at every point leading up to the election, it was pretty much a given that Biden had it in the bag.

Why now, even with Kamala leading the helm, does it seem like things are so much closer than they were four years ago? I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala. Why isn't that energy reflecting in the numbers?"
"I was nauseously worried for the last couple of weeks because of how things were looking, but because of how things have been shaping over the last week, I am for certain she will win, and we will not be going back!!  I like the path that we are currently on, and she will only strengthen our country and unite all of America. Please everyone remain calm and make sure to get everyone out to vote on Tuesday so we can have a landslide victory like President Obama’s two elections!"
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
That’s all. 
"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.

"I've done phone banking and canvassing for Harris in Pennsylvania. A couple things that scare/disappoint me:

1. The amount of people, primarily in their 20s or 30s, that have told me they do not like Trump, feel like he would be terrible for the country, and are registered to vote (and vote in local elections) but ""I don't vote in Presidential elections."" 🤯

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference."

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

"Link to article on the vote today:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-block-another-vote-ivf-protections-harris-makes-2024-issue-rcna171463

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent."
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

3.) [JD Vance has outright stated Kamala can ""go to hell"" in response to Kamala's criticism of the Arlington National Cemetery incident.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/-can-go-hell-vance-blasts-harris-afghanistan-withdrawal-harshest-rheto-rcna168691)

This story has begun to gain widespread coverage. Do you think this will move the needle or have significant consequences for the Trump campaign?

UPDATE:

Campaign Adviser Chris LaVita has responded with a tweet, reposting some ANC footage to ""trigger the hacks"" [at the US Army](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-trump-makes-arlington-cemetery-194619206.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJAP3X4HVJQGZl20q6ahz4qN1qHnWUJrDxL7r1X1ePhA6yeF7G94C5HkGAGa5eurSQ45Kc-hTe0RMa0W-TeaQVKu37UYIQvR-MwDqSoc_vZjgeLgi-sgP8wMWzHhj5vfsLasOXEmLuqUCrlxqnECFFPiHZRkvUCtTFvzncIgsMe)."
"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?"

"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

I'm curious to hear what this community thinks. Do you believe RCV is a viable alternative for U.S. elections? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? Are there better alternatives to consider? I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have experience with RCV in their local elections or who have studied the impact of different voting systems."

While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months? 

Here's the clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab\_channel=SkyNewsAustralia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUbHOeUbZp8&ab_channel=SkyNewsAustralia)"
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"Someone already did they which made me want to post my own. (Can we have a pinned thread for these so people can post theirs and we can see who’s right?). Anyways, here it is. The first map is my opinion on the likelihood of each state, the second is the final results."
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"To clarify:

I'm not asking how his base will respond in the immediate aftermath, but rather how the GOP as a party would react to Trump losing two consecutive elections. Not to mention that Trump is currently 78 years old.

Do you think they will pivot away from the MAGA movement/ rhetoric? Will they find a younger candidate to carry the Trump torch? In essence, how will they attempt to regain traction after two failed attempts at the White House?

Obviously this is still a hypothetical, as the election is far from over. Get out and vote!"
"Recently, Trump has promised:

He will create a Bitcoin stockpile. Basically he says he will not sell the Bitcoin the US seizes from criminals. He stopped short of promising to buy Bitcoin as some other candidates did. Bitcoin holders were very enthusiastic about the proposal because a sell off of that much Bitcoin could decrease the price. It’s unclear how this would benefit anyone else. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/07/27/trump-bitcoin-conference-harris.html

""Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control,"" Trump said during his keynote speech.

At the same conference he said he’s going to increase electricity production to the point where we will be begging him to stop. 

“We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, please, please, president, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it. You'll be begging me. No more electricity, sir. We have enough. We have enough.”

There are signs the new data centers driven by AI  and Bitcoin mining will place a strain on US energy supplies. Trump is officially hostile to this energy being clean or renewable energy, he’s repeatedly singled out wind energy as dangerous. 

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/07/17/why-trump-is-talking-about-your-electric-bill-00169041

But economists say Trump, who wants to cut taxes for fossil fuel producers and roll back federal support for renewable energy, would have little influence over power prices, especially in the short run.

“They could say we’re just going all in on fossil fuels and to hell with the carbon emissions. That would probably have some effect, but relatively small,” said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

He says he’s going to remove the tax seniors pay on Social Security. 

https://rollcall.com/2024/07/31/trump-pitches-repealing-tax-on-social-security-benefits/

The cost of fully exempting Social Security benefits from taxes could top $1.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. The policy has some supporters on both sides of the aisle in Congress, but so far legislative proposals have failed to pick up momentum.

“SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media website, Truth Social.

So, do any of these seem like winners? Things that would move the needle?

"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "
"With many Muslims refusing to vote for Kamala over the Biden administration's policies with regards to Palestine, why hasn't a very serious situation such as the Muslim ban been brought up in 2024? Many Republicans keep saying ""look at what Trump will do based on his first term."" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it? "
"Here are a few ideas I have. Please feel free to add your own. I feel like the Dems have no teeth or common sense anymore when it comes to strategy.

Media campaign showing Kamala speaking about:

	1.	Her foreign policy on keeping us strong in the face of destabilization in the Middle East, Europe, and South America.
	2.	Her plan for the economy. We can’t afford a recession or inflation, so let’s focus on reducing real estate and food costs.
	3.	A detailed analysis with facts and figures on how Trump has hurt our economy and country.
	4.	Her public support of law enforcement, entrepreneurship (especially for women), and education, with a focus on science and engineering initiatives to help us compete in the new tech economy.
	5.	Her approach to immigration, highlighting the need to overhaul the application system to properly vet and support incoming families who can contribute to our economy."
"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"

"JD just had an interview with the New York times in which he refused to admit Trump lost the election in 2020 5 times in a row. 

The question matters in regards to the general population ability to trust our election process. Trump's investigation team dug into the 2020 election and found little to no evidence of material that would discredit the election

They lost 63 court cases appealing the election results

My question is do you guys understand why this question is important. And if you are considering Trump does JD refusing to answer this question matter to you? "

While the comedian's joke has gotten plenty of airtime in the media and has activated Democrats in to thinking this can be used as a cudgel against Trump, how will Biden's comment reverberate in the final week of the campaign? Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's ""Deplorables"" comment?

What impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?

"I just need to rant and apologize to everyone that’s a human being. I used to be a HUGE Trump supporter from 2015-2020. I was without a doubt brainwashed by family and my school. In middle school, my teacher told the class about how democrats are so awful (specifically Hilary Clinton and the embassy situation) too. Now as a 22 year old man, I’m proud to say I’m a strong democrat! I was part of the problem, I used to genuinely believe the election was rigged and Trump was America’s savior, and I’m ashamed that I used to have that mindset. My girlfriend tells me she’s proud of me because of how hard it is for some people to change political opinions, especially from right to left, which certainly makes me feel better. Can’t wait to vote on Tuesday for human rights and democracy , let’s go Harris Walz 💙"
"Some people don't want the dems to know how many ballots they need to win by on election day and they are holding their vote until then. That is absolutely your right. Please dear god go early on election day, no delays pack a snack. Even at early voting sites they have been closing early, and changing the rules. There is no recourse at that point on the day of. Go early do not be the vote that is turned away at 8pm 9pm. I do not want to see our voters still waiting in line on the news! Tell everyone go as early as possible that day!!!! Post it on your socials go early!"
"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"

"Economic Policies

* **Middle Class Strengthening**: Harris focuses on building up the middle class, stating that a strong middle class leads to a strong America. She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave. She focuses on building a future where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead, including owning a home and building inter-generational wealth. Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.
* **Gun Control**: Harris advocates for stronger gun control measures, including passing red flag laws, universal background checks, and an assault weapons ban.
* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

* **Immigration reform:** Harris emphasizes her experience in dealing with border security as Attorney General of California, highlighting her work against transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. She promises to reintroduce and sign the border security bill that Trump previously opposed.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"

I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess.

"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "

Note: I don’t consider judge chutkan unsealing evidence in the Trump DC case because it’s only coming out now because his lawyers delayed it so much. It is a normal court schedule so I don’t think it falls under the October surprise definition "
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?

They're in a terrible election year for them and it's an uphill battle to keep a majority."

"According to this article, climate change is only the 19th most highly ranked issue among key issues considered by registered voters.

"Of course, this does not indicate that we can be complacent again, but we’re moving in the right direction!"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued.""

"George W Bush narrowly won in 2000 by 537 votes in Florida and 2004 by 80,000 votes in Ohio. Donald J Trump narrowly won in 2016 by 77,000 votes in the Rust-Belt. Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by 77,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. How was Barack Obama able to win more decisively in 2008 and 2012?"
I feel like the Republicans are going to have their come to Jesus moment when Democrats take both the house and senate along with the presidency. Paul Ryan is my guess. He was one of the first people to call Trump out. I know there will be the usual suspects the Nikki Haley’s and Ramaswarmys but I feel like it will end up being him in 4 years.
"What is it that makes Pennsylvania such a bellwether state, so close between Democrats and Republicans? 

On paper it's a metro state, close to New York and the eastern coast of the United States so to me it should be a clear blue state.

Why is it so purple and why is it seen as the key to either Trump or Harris winning the White House?"
Color me surprised... 
"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"

"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

"Has this ever happened before in US history?  Like this seems crazy to me!!  Like a new potential president was just placed into power it’s crazy!

**Question** How many times has something like this happened?  And like why?  Or is this a new thing? "
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"While the race still has room to change before November, this year's polling is still important for knowing what will happen then. The only question is how much it will reflect the results.

Famously, polling vastly underestimated Donald Trump in 2016. In 2020, it wasn't much different. According to Realclearpolitics on this day 8 years ago, Clinton was ahead in Michigan by 5.2 points. 4 years ago, Biden was ahead by 6.3 points. On election day, Biden improved on Clinton's margin by 3 points.

Personally I started paying attention to politics in 2016 and kept that up in 2020. I internalized as a general rule that Democrats underperform in polling, but that isn't actually the case. In 2012 Romney was in the lead most most of the race, but of course Obama won by nearly the same margin as 2008.

So what do you think? "

How are Gen Z’s political views aligned or not aligned with Gen X and millennials?

"I am a duo citizen living in Canada and half of my family lives in America. I was born and Canada however I am getting my ducks in line to move to the east coast United States. 

I just voted republican in my first presidential election. I would hate to see America turn into what Canada is right now, we are suffering here. I can't share this as the majority of people in my circle are democrats."
"Edit: I should have been a bit more precise with the title, the event is not organized by the trump campaign. It is just being held at one of his flagship properties, he is the invited keynote speaker, and he has spoken often in support of these groups and individuals. But saying he is “planning” the event is not accurate. 


Pretty much said it in the title. 
My hunch is that reminding voters about the events of January 6 and specifically taking a rather ridiculous position trying to reframe the events as a patriotic, positive event are much more likely to backfire than actually convince anyone outside the MAGA tent that these people are actually heroes. 

Does this event have any impact on the elections/polling, or is it just another minor blip on the Trump controversy radar? (It’s a very busy radar.)

"The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

"Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.

What do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?"
"With the impending second loss for Kari Lake, trouncing of Mark Robinson, and the PA losses of Doug Mastriano and Dr. Oz two years ago, it seems Trump doesn’t have a great track record with his endorsements. However, it seems he has always defied the odds in each presidential election poll wise. So what’s the deal with this discrepancy? "
"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"An NPR piece came out this morning about Trump and the cemetery incident, and for several hours, clicking on the link from Twitter brought up the following:

""Warning: this link may be unsafe""

I've noticed my feed take a hard right shift, but this was new, a warning about NPR?

How much of this is Musk vs. the algorithms, vs. user behavior?

Will it swing voters?"
"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."
"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"
"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.  
  
"
"From 1912 to 1988, 14 of the 20 winners earned over 400 electoral votes. From 1992 to 2020 (and likely 2024), none of the 8 (9) winners will earn 400 electoral votes.

What is the root cause for such close elections in recent history?"
"How do we prepare for another insurrection attempt (or in Trump’s words, J6 2.0)?"
"Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?"
"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"
"Will I be able to watch it live for free on YouTube? I particularly love watching Steve Kornacki cover the election, but I don’t live at my parents house anymore, so I can’t just watch it on their TVs. I have to find a new way to follow the election this year. Thanks"

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

My jaw dropped when I read it. I replied that her toddler granddaughter thanks her for voting for her future 
"I’m from NY moved to NC 5 years ago- what we have noticed since COVID is the number of not only remote jobs but the opportunity to relocate. Many people have moved from their home states to other places with changes in family and social dynamics post-Covid and with the rise of remote work. 

My belief is we will see a state or two we assume will vote blue or red flip due to increased migration in our country as many voters are now in new places. What do y’all think! "

"When people often talk about presidential elections, there is often a point on whether or not a state could eventually be competitive or if a state will permanently stay the same color.

A common topic which comes under this discussion is Kansas and Minnesota since they are the states which have the longest streak of going red and blue respectively.

However, these states have shown to be trending in a more elastic fashion as Minnesota is heavily relying on the twin cities and Duluth to keep it in the Blue column as seen in 2016 Hilary won Minnesota by less than 2%, with the state even being considered competitive by few medias before Biden dropped out

Kansas on the other hand is starting to trend to the left since 2016 when the once conservative and populous Johnson County started shifting left. It went on to be blue in 2020 and continued that trend even in the 2022 midterms. While KS likely isn't flipping anytime soon, recent trends could mean that the state is a lot more elastic as the Joco, Wichita, and Topeka areas gradually expand in population.

So with KS and MN out of the way, what are the red and blue states which you think have no chance of ever flipping?"
"There should be no surprise if DJT declares the 2024 US Presidential Election a fraud and the election stolen from him once again.  

Given that Biden remains in power through the transition in January, what are the risks of seeing mob violence before this occurs?  

What do you think will happen should DJT make such a declaration?  "
Just a reminder that we beat ourselves in 2016. Vice President Harris is rising in the polls but let's never take anything for granted. Trump would have been a distant memory by now if we wouldn't have assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win. There is still a lot of sexism and misogyny to overcome. Vote! 
"
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"Liz Cheney has recently been campaigning for Kamala with the hope that she can convince conservatives who don’t like Trump to vote for Kamala. On the other hand, a lot of progressives don’t like the Cheney name and associate (correctly) her father’s role in the Iraq war and Neo conservatism in general. What do you think?  Will she help attract conservatives or just turn off progressives?  Which do you think will be the bigger factor?  Is embracing Cheney a good or bad strategy for the Harris campaign?"
"We know that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, trump was significantly undercounted by polling, which led to unexpectedly close races in both years, the first of which he won. What are the odds that it's Kamala being undercounted this time rather than trump? Polling seems to indicate that this year will be as tight of not tighter than previous elections, but what is that due to? Is trump being accurately polled this time or is Kamala being underestimated for some reason?"
"Nicole Shanahan (the billionaire funding RFK's campaign) mentioned possibly doing so in an interview recently. How would this potential move affect the trajectory of the election? 
Presumably, Trump's chances of election would at least match Harris's, if not put him in slight favor of winning. 

Additionally: is this merger even likely to happen? RFK Jr's campaign has persistently utilized the ""any news is good news"" strategy, so this is possibly another ploy."

"Considering independent/undecided voters are more likely to choose the candidate that aligns best with their values (regardless of party), will independent voters be more likely to choose local Democrats for office?"
"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

"According to the CDC, America has suffered over 1.2 million deaths from COVID to date. What stands out is that over 90% of these deaths are in people over the age of 50. Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?

Will the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?

Which political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic? Interested to hear thoughts on how these numbers might play into the broader political landscape this election season."

"Trump has gone back to the policy focus that launched him into the presidency in 2016 by placing immigration at the heart of his 2024 campaign, a strategy he hopes will help him secure a lead over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the run-up to the US election. 

He is also vowing to recreate the low-inflation economy of his first term to win over voters angry at the steep rises in prices and interest rates during Joe Biden's four years in the White House.

These are some of his key promises:  
• Rounding up illegal immigrants in camps and launching “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”

• Ending the war in Ukraine on his first day in office  
  
• Building a “state-of-the-art next-generation missile defence shield” for the US  
  
• Introducing up to ten new “freedom cities” and an anti-woke university  
  
• An energy policy he sums up as “drill, baby, drill""   
  
• A central credentialling system for teachers to show they “embrace patriotic values”

"Hello! I’ve been having more than a handful of conversations with my parents as of late (Baby Boomer generation) about the upcoming election and they are constantly siding with Trump and throwing shade at Kamala. While I am always doing the research to prove my point (usually 1 simple Google search), they seem to just go off of hearsay and fake news (go figure), spouting how they are voting for the best interest of their kids and grandkids, which is in Trump. They don’t even know what Project 2025 is, nor will they educate themselves after me sending articles on it!


Does anyone have a decent list of points for why it’s in our best interest to vote Blue this upcoming election so I can continue my attempt in educating my parents on the matter? I’m trying my best in the knowledge I know, but sometimes it can be difficult breaking through an ignorant wall. Cheers!"

An October surprise is a news event that may influence the outcome of an upcoming November election (particularly one for the presidency), whether deliberately planned or spontaneously occurring.

Passed October surprises:

2020: Hunter Biden’s laptop 

2016: Comey/Hillary’s emails 

2012: Christie and Obama during Hurricane Sandy (not sure I agree this warrants the term)


What could be something this year?"
"It's something I've been thinking about, and then today I see Sky News talking about it, and showing clips from Biden's recent event he was at where he forgot who he was introducing. While discussing the clip it was predicted that Biden would step down some time in October making Kamala president. What effect do you guys think this would have on the election? Do you think it would increase her odds of winning/or losing. 

Wouldn't that kind of suck the be the first female president and for that to be her of all people and if she loses the election to only be in office for about three months?

Is the republican going to win the presidential race a guaranteed blue state?

"Kamala Harris has received a substantial amount of support from the American general public but  lot of her stated positions and policies(primarily around Gaza) have been unsatisfactory or outright repudiated by the progressive elements of the Democratic Party. 

Given how outspoken the dissatisfaction of this subset of the electorate is and with groups like the uncommitted movement being very unsupportive of Harris and essentially threatening to withhold their votes and give Donald Trump a victory in states like Michigan, how real is the concern that Harris not being more left leaning could cost her votes and have her lose? It’s a tight race and every vote counts does it not? "
"POST THIS EVERYWHERE- because Commie Kamala  claims that if elected, she won't take anyone's firearms away.

Footage shows Kamala - when she was the San Francisco DA - talking about entering private homes to check how private gun owners are storing their firearms. 

  
As San Francisco's district attorney, Kamala Harris told legal gun owners in her community that authorities could ""walk into"" their homes to inspect whether they were storing their firearms properly under a new law she helped draft.

  
""We're going to require responsible behaviors among everybody in the community, and **just because you legally possess a gun in the sanctity of your locked home doesn't mean that we're not going to walk into that home and check to see if you're being responsible and safe in the way you conduct your affairs**,"" Harris told a group of reporters in May 2007. 

  
The remarks came during a press conference introducing legislation that Harris helped draft, which sought to impose penalties for gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly at home. 

  
The bill, which at the time had just been introduced to the city's board of supervisors, was ultimately signed into law a few months later by then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.

  
It was bundled with other gun control provisions, including a new requirement for legal gun distributors to submit an inventory to the chief of police every six months, and a ban on possessing guns – even legally – in public housing.

  
""San Francisco now has the strictest anti-gun laws in the county,"" Newsom said when he signed the new laws.

"In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/\)) and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years. If a state was unwilling or unable to certify the results of their election, who would decide the winner of the presidential election?

Would it cause a vote in the House of Representatives to select the president? [The 12th Amendment](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R40504.pdf) to the Constitution requires that presidential and vice presidential candidates
gain “a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed” in order to win election. With a total
of 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 270 electoral votes is the
“magic number,” the arithmetic majority necessary to win the presidency. What would happen if no candidate won a majority of electoral votes? In these circumstances, the
12th Amendment also provides that the House of Representatives would elect the President, and
the Senate would elect the Vice President, in a procedure known as “contingent election.”  

Or would it end up in the courts to determine the outcome such as the [2000 Bush v. Gore](https://www.history.com/news/2000-election-bush-gore-votes-supreme-court) Supreme Court decision?"

"In 2016, Trump ran against Clinton who would have been the first woman US president and won. Then he won against Biden who is a man and lost. If Trump wins in 2024, he will have won against 2 women and lost to 1 man while running for President. 

What will be the political consequences of this going forward? Will parties be less willing to field women candidates?"
"I don't live in a state with a close senate election, so maybe the people of Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Montana feel differently, but are the Democrats doing enough in pushing ""get out the vote"" efforts. Are they campaigning in media enough in these areas?
