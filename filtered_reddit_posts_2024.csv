It is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes.  The candidates' microphones will, under rules negotiated between the Biden and Trump campaigns, be muted in the absence of ""significant crosstalk"".  The [full rules for tonight's debate can be found here on ABC's site](https://abc.com/news/5e38600c-4732-4cd2-a99c-3dedfa81beb0/category/1138628).  Per [a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5106660/election-poll-harris-trump-debate), ""Seven-in-10 Americans say they are going to watch the first presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and 3-in-10 say it will help decide their vote"".

Tonight's debate is the only remaining presidential-level debate scheduled for this cycle; the Vice Presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio senator J.D. Vance is scheduled for October 1st.

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges that Trump killed the biggest border security bill in decades so he could campaign on the issue instead. What will this mean for the election?,"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic? Or will his strategy work?",1528,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gi79lt/republican_senate_leader_mitch_mcconnell/,306,1730583881.0,Spiderwig144,2024-11-02 21:44:41,republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledge Trump kill big border security bill decade campaign issue instead mean election,"link word

"If Donald Trump loses the 2024 presidential election and does not run in 2028, do you believe the GOP’s platform will shift? If so, how?","
If Donald Trump loses this year’s election and is no longer a factor and won’t run in 2028 (due to health issues, legal challenges, or other reasons, including possibly being deceased), do you believe the GOP platform will undergo change or reform?

I ask because after the 2012 election and the Republican Party losing the Presidential race twice in a row (just like in this scenario), the GOP was expected to undergo reform in response to its poor performance, aiming for a broader appeal with minorities, a more inclusive approach to immigration, increased candidate diversity, and other changes.

"The Washington Post announced today that it will not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s, citing historical tradition of neutrality. Is it in our best interest for media outlets to project a neutral stance? And why have they chosen this election to make the change?","The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration?

There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.

1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other?

PBS has released its final [NPR/Marist] election poll giving Harris a 4% [51-47] lead among likely voters. The 2020 election was also 51 to 47 percent.  Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map? ,"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

"Which protest vote is going to sway the election more, the Democrats not voting for Harris because of the Gaza issue, or the Republicans not voting for Trump because of the MAGA issue? ","There are a lot of issues on the table that people are considering this election: economy, abortion, immigration, wars, and on and on. 

But there are also people who are voting on other than the hot button issues. The moral vote, or the protest vote. And each party seems to have a prominent division based on this moral vote. 

On the Republican side, whether it’s the Republican Veterans Against Trump (RVAT), Never Trumpers, Lincoln project, etc, what they all have in common is that they’re all republicans who will tell you that they have a moral obligation to not vote for Trump. This Republican faction is what delivered Biden the 2020 win. 

On the Democratic side, you have a segment of the Democratic Party who are planning not to vote for Harris because of her stance on the Gaza issue. While this issue casts a wide net demographically, it mostly consists of Muslims, Arab Americans, and black Americans who find themselves deeply connected with this issue. Of course, Trump won’t be any better on this issue but this is a faction of would-be Democrats, so they wouldn’t vote for Trump anyway. 

So, what faction is a bigger threat to their respective parties? The never Trump republicans not voting for Trump, or the Gaza protesters not voting for Harris?

"Who is the ""heir apparent"" for the 2028 Presidential Election in either party?","Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?",251,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fjueb8/who_is_the_heir_apparent_for_the_2028/,625,1726670280.0,TheRealWhiteChoco,2024-09-18 14:38:00,heir apparent 2028 Presidential Election party,"let preface say 2028 obviously super long time away intent purpose know go win 2024 appear come wire think fun speculate look later prediction pan

"If Harris wins by 270 or 276 electoral votes the day after the election, how long will it likely take to settle who will be the 47th President definitively?","Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders have touted their support for IVF in recent months, but when it comes to a vote, they've been voting against it. There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.

If Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.

A pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent.",478,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fjdrma/republicans_have_blocked_a_bill_to_protect_ivf/,232,1726614208.0,Spiderwig144,2024-09-17 23:03:28,Republicans block bill protect IVF access nationwide America thought impact think election,"link article vote today

"If Donald Trump loses the 2024 election and flees the country to escape prosecution, would it end or significantly harm the MAGA movement?","It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

So what does this race come down to? What’s the decisive issue that will determine who will be the next president? 

A) new face in the office. Trump has been in office before and Kamala is the unknown candidate. So if the voters are voting out of curiosity, this will favor her. 

B) economy. We’re being told the economy is doing fabulous but people are hurting. Prices are inflated and companies are price gouging. This was a much bigger issue just a couple months ago but voters are turning around on the issue. Still, if this comes back, this favors Trump. 

C) Ukraine and Gaza. Trump is a lot of things but perhaps the one thing both sides can agree on is that he’s not a war mongerer. Kamala was VP to Biden as both wars broke out under his watch. Specifically on Gaza, this has touched the Arab/muslim population as well as the young population and if even a sizable percentage of them sit out, this is a Trump win. 

D) abortion. Democrats won 2020 and stopped a red wave in 2022 on abortion. This is still very much a live issue. If this issue becomes front and center, Kamala wins. 

E) immigration. This is something Trump has been inserting into every answer, regardless of the question he is asked, and for good reason. The issue favors him. If immigration becomes the issue of the day, Trump wins.

What impact does this potentially play in the lead-up to the election?,"Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-army-defends-arlington-national-cemetery-employee-trump-campaign-incident-2024-08-29/

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

She supports policies that provide affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid family leave.

Harris pledges to fight against hidden fees, surprise charges, corporate landlord rent increases, and high prescription drug costs.
* **Support for Women and Families**: Harris advocates for a future with affordable healthcare, childcare, and paid leave. She emphasizes the importance of equal pay for women, highlighting that improving the economic status of women benefits children, families, and society.

Social Policies

* **Healthcare**: Harris supports maintaining and expanding the Affordable Care Act to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage.
* **Reproductive Rights**: She strongly supports reproductive freedom and opposes Trump's extreme abortion bans. She promises to sign laws that restore reproductive freedoms if passed by Congress.

* **Voting Rights**: She emphasizes the importance of protecting the sacred freedom to vote and ensuring every American's ballot is counted.

# Immigration and Border Security

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

"Will Lt. Gov Robinson's ""Pizza box in the booth"" scandal cost Trump NC and as a result the 2024 election? (The guy Trump called the next MLK)","Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

"Biden plausibly called Trump supporters ""garbage"". Is this what the last week of the election will be like?","Just prior to Harris' speech in DC, President Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" in reference to the comedian's ill-timed joke at recent Trump's MSG rally.

I'm a registered Democrat and I'm voting for Trump this election,"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years.

I'm a registered Democrat and I'm voting for Trump this election,"I live in a very liberal state. Voted Democrat in the previous elections, but after the last four years, enough is enough. I lost my job early this year. Found it really hard to find another job (took several months) and I got a fraction of what I made earlier. I know many others in my circle that got laid off and are struggling as well. With record inflation everything is so expensive and I'm only afloat cause my family helped me out. Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump.

However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.
