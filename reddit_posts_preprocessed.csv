It is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Eastern and last for 90 minutes.  The candidates' microphones will, under rules negotiated between the Biden and Trump campaigns, be muted in the absence of ""significant crosstalk"".  The [full rules for tonight's debate can be found here on ABC's site](https://abc.com/news/5e38600c-4732-4cd2-a99c-3dedfa81beb0/category/1138628).  Per [a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5106660/election-poll-harris-trump-debate), ""Seven-in-10 Americans say they are going to watch the first presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and 3-in-10 say it will help decide their vote"".

Tonight's debate is the only remaining presidential-level debate scheduled for this cycle; the Vice Presidential debate between Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Ohio senator J.D. Vance is scheduled for October 1st.

Why did Kamala Harris lose the election?,"Pennsylvania has just been called. This was the lynchpin state that hopes of a Harris win was resting on. Trump just won it. The election is effectively over. 

So what happened? Just a day ago, Harris was projected to win Iowa by +4. The campaign was so hopeful that they were thinking about picking off Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas. 

What went so horribly wrong that the polls were so off and so misleading?

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell acknowledges that Trump killed the biggest border security bill in decades so he could campaign on the issue instead. What will this mean for the election?,"Link to his words on it:

* https://x.com/harris_wins/status/1848005868320702568

And here's a link to the bill being killed earlier this year:

* https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-republicans-block-border-security-bill-campaign-border-chaos-rcna153607

McConnell had given the green light for James Lankford, a conservative Republican, to negotiate a comprehensive border security package with Democrats led by Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate border state Senator from Arizona. The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. 

Since then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. 

What sort of impact do you think this will have on the election? Will it move voters? Will people see the truth behind the dynamic?

"Donald Trump has told donors he will crush pro-Palestinian protests, deport any foreign student found to be taking part, and set the pro-Palestine movement ""back 25 or 30 years"" if re-elected. What are your thoughts on this, and what if any impact does it have on the presidential race?","Link to source going into more detail:

* https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/27/trump-donors-israel-gaza-palestinian-protests

Trump called the demonstrations against Israel's war in Gaza a part of a ""radical revolution"" that needs to be put down. He also praised the New York Police Department's infamous clear-out of encampments at Columbia University as a model for the nation. 

Another interesting part was Trump changing his tune on Israel's offensive. In public he has been very cautious in his comments as his campaign believes the war is hurting President Biden's support among key constituencies like young people and people of color, so he has only made vague references to how Israel is “losing the PR war” and how we have to get back to peace. But in private Trump is telling donors and supporters that he will support Israel's right to defend itself and continue its ""war on terror"", as well as boasting about his track record of pro-Israel policy including moving the US embassy there to Jerusalem in 2018 and making the US the first country to recognize the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in 2019. 

And what are your thoughts on how this could impact the election? Does it add more fuel to the argument that a vote for Trump is a vote for unbridled fascism to be unleashed in the US?

What can Democrats do to not get annihilated in another election? ,"What changes can they make? What should they prioritize, and what shouldn’t they spend so much energy on? 

Should they go more centrist/right or go more progressive? 

Whats the winning message? 

Donald Trump didn’t just win. He won in a landslide. He won all 7 battleground states. He even won the popular vote, which is a first for republicans in decades. It was a thorough ass-kicking. 

 
The trends are clear. Hispanics, by and large, are trending towards Republican. Thats concerning because the hispanic vote is a large voting group. 

Democrats are also losing white women. Which is even more concerning because it’s impossible to win an election without white women. 

So what’s the problem? Are democrats virtue signaling too much? Should they tamp down some of the more controversial stances republicans love to hammer away, like transgender women in women sports (which quite literally effects like 2 people in the country but makes up for 50% of Republican talking points)? Should democrats be more fiery and aggressive, since that is what worked for Trump? 

Should Democrats make Bernie Sanders the party leader and have him run in 2028? He’s getting older but if Trump can be president at 78, why not Bernie who’s only a few years older than him but seems to be more mentally there?

Are Trump and the republicans over-reading their 2024 election win? ,"After Trump’s surprise 2024 election win, there’s a word we’ve been hearing a lot: mandate. 

While Trump did manage to capture all seven battleground states, his overall margin of victory was 1.5%. Ironically, he did better in blue states than he did in swing states. 

To put that into perspective, Hillary had a popular vote win margin of 2%. And Biden had a 5% win margin. 

People have their list of theories for why Trump won but the correct answer is usually the obvious one: we’re in a bad economy and people are hurting financially. 

Are Trump and republicans overplaying their hand now that they eeked out a victory and have a trifecta in their hands, as well as SCOTUS? 

An economically frustrated populace has given them all of the keys to the government, are they mistaking this to mean that America has rubber stamped all of their wild ideas from project 2025, agenda 47, and whatever fanciful new ideas come to their minds?

"The Washington Post announced today that it will not endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since the 1980s, citing historical tradition of neutrality. Is it in our best interest for media outlets to project a neutral stance? And why have they chosen this election to make the change?","The Washington Post CEO William Lewis published an editorial today (sourced below) that the Washington Post will be ""returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates."" He says they will not endorse a candidate this election, nor for any future elections. 

This has caused backlash within the Washington Post staff, according to NPR. 

Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron denounced the decision writing: 

> ""This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty,"" Baron said in a statement to NPR. ""Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners). History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.""

Our country is deeply divided in terms of media consumption and trust. Is this an an attempt at trying to bring some balance, or is there more at play? Should more media outlets refrain from endorsement, or is that an important element of election dialogue? Why has the Washington Post chosen this election to make the change?

Will it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies?

2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)

3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.

4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) 

5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is 

Even if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.

Questions about the rumour itself:

1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) 

2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? 

Questions about the election:

1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote?

PBS has released its final [NPR/Marist] election poll giving Harris a 4% [51-47] lead among likely voters. The 2020 election was also 51 to 47 percent.  Just hours from election day does this data have some predictive value in assessing electoral college map? ,"Trump still leads among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55% of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice president’s lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020.

Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters – down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020.

Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump.

More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris.

>After hearing President Trump tried to persuade Ukraine to investigate a 2020 campaign rival, senior officials at the White House scrambled to “lock down” records of the call, in particular the official complete transcript, a whistle-blower alleged in an explosive complaint released Thursday.

>In an attempt to “lock down” all records of the call, White House lawyers told officials to move an electronic transcript of the call into a separate system reserved for classified information that is especially sensitive, the complaint said. During the call, Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

>The president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Attorney General William P. Barr were involved in the effort as well, the complaint said.

"Which protest vote is going to sway the election more, the Democrats not voting for Harris because of the Gaza issue, or the Republicans not voting for Trump because of the MAGA issue? ","There are a lot of issues on the table that people are considering this election: economy, abortion, immigration, wars, and on and on. 

But there are also people who are voting on other than the hot button issues. The moral vote, or the protest vote. And each party seems to have a prominent division based on this moral vote. 

On the Republican side, whether it’s the Republican Veterans Against Trump (RVAT), Never Trumpers, Lincoln project, etc, what they all have in common is that they’re all republicans who will tell you that they have a moral obligation to not vote for Trump. This Republican faction is what delivered Biden the 2020 win. 

On the Democratic side, you have a segment of the Democratic Party who are planning not to vote for Harris because of her stance on the Gaza issue. While this issue casts a wide net demographically, it mostly consists of Muslims, Arab Americans, and black Americans who find themselves deeply connected with this issue. Of course, Trump won’t be any better on this issue but this is a faction of would-be Democrats, so they wouldn’t vote for Trump anyway. 

So, what faction is a bigger threat to their respective parties? The never Trump republicans not voting for Trump, or the Gaza protesters not voting for Harris? 

Who is more likely to lose this election because of the protest vote?

"Who is the ""heir apparent"" for the 2028 Presidential Election in either party?","Let me preface this by saying that 2028 is obviously a super long time away, and by all intents and purposes we don't know who is going to win in 2024 as it appears to be one that'll come down to the wire. However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.

If Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?

If Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?",251,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fjueb8/who_is_the_heir_apparent_for_the_2028/,625,1726670280.0,TheRealWhiteChoco,heir apparent 2028 Presidential Election party,"let preface say 2028 obviously super long time away intent purpose know go win 2024 appear come wire think fun speculate look later prediction pan

Neither Biden nor Trump will get as big of a stage with as many eyeballs as this presidential debate. There could be a second presedential debate but that’s up in the air, unless both of them (more realistically Trump) agrees to it.

"If Harris wins by 270 or 276 electoral votes the day after the election, how long will it likely take to settle who will be the 47th President definitively?","Both the NYT and Nate’s Silver Bulletin forecast a close race. In simulations there are solid likelihoods that if Harris wins, 270 or 276 may be the electoral outcome.

Of course, polling error of 3-4 percent greatly exceeds small bumps in polls. 

I’m curious what happens after a close Harris win scenario if results are disputed. 

Might it take until SCOTUS weighs in on specific electoral challenges? 2-3 rounds of hand counting ballots?

For example, Nate Silver’s forecast shows MI, WI, NV and gaining .8 to .9 towards Trump in polls but still potentially a Harris win.  

At the same time the forecasted margin for must-win states for Trump like NC and Georgia are under 1 percent in Trump’s favor.

These results may all be delayed, likely challenged, and move through state and possibly SCOTUS elections and legal processes.

"Joe Biden just announced that the federal government is forgiving $10,000 in student loans for most borrowers, as well as capping monthly payments and halting interest on timely payments. Is this good policy? How might this shape upcoming elections?","Under Biden's loan forgiveness order, individuals earning less than $125K ($250K for married couples) will qualify for $10K in loan forgiveness, plus another $10K if they received a Pell Grant to go to school. Pell grants are financial aid provided to people who display [""exceptional financial need and have not already earned an undergraduate degree""](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell).

The order also contains some additional benefits:

* Student loan interest is deferred until 12/31/2022 (the final deferment per the order);

* Monthly payments for students on income-based repayment plans are capped at 5% of monthly income; and

* Pauses interest accrual where the borrower is making proper monthly payments, preventing the loan balance from growing when monthly payments are being made.

* Strengthens the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to avoid implementation failures and confusing eligibility requirements.

Legal scholars broadly seem to agree that this is within the President's executive power, since the forgiveness applies only to federal student loan debt, but there is some disagreement on the subject.

Conservative groups have raised concerns about inflation, tuition growth, and increased borrowing from students expecting future loan forgiveness, or fundamental fairness issues for people who paid off their loans. Cynics have accused Biden of ""buying votes"". 

Polling indicates that voters [support student loan forgiveness, but would prefer the government address tuition costs](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/npr-student-loan-forgiveness-2022), though Biden has expressed an intention to do the latter as well.

"If Donald Trump loses the 2024 election and flees the country to escape prosecution, would it end or significantly harm the MAGA movement?","It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.

On one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.

On the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.

"In the primaries, Trump keeps underperforming relative to the polls. Will this likely carry over into the general election?","In each of the Republican primaries so far, Trump’s support was several percentage points less than what polls indicated. See here for a breakdown of poll numbers vs. results state by state: [https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-underperform-michigan-gop-primary-results-1874325](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-underperform-michigan-gop-primary-results-1874325)

Do you think this pattern will likely hold in the general election?

On the one hand, there’s a strong anti-Trump sentiment among many voters, and if primary polls are failing to fully capture it, it’s reasonable to suspect general election polls are also failing to do so.

On the other hand, primaries are harder for polls to predict than general elections, because the pool of potential voters in general elections (basically every citizen 18 and above) is more clear than in primaries (which vary in who they allow to vote).

Note that this question isn’t “boy, polls sure are random and stupid, aren’t they, hahaha.” If Trump were underperforming in half the primaries and overperforming in the other half, then yes, that would be all we could say, but that’s not the case. The point of this question is that there’s an actual \*clear pattern\* in the primary polls vs. primary results so far.

"Republicans just blocked a bill to protect IVF access nationwide. What are your thoughts on this, and what if any impact do you think it will have on elections this fall?","Link to source on the news here:

* https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/senate-ivf-bill-vote/index.html

The bill would enshrine a right for people to receive IVF treatment and a right for doctors to provide said treatment into federal law. It would also make treatment more affordable by mandating coverage under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans, as well as expand coverage under military service members and veterans’ health care. Finally, the bill would override any state-level attempts to restrict it. 

With the exception of Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, every Republican in the Senate voted against it, while Republican leaders in the House suggested they wouldn't even take up the legislation if it passed. They argue that there are no present restrictions on IVF so there is no need to codify access, that it is a solution without a problem. The Senate GOP instead signed on to a symbolic resolution saying they support IVF, even as they voted against the bill and despite hundreds of House Republicans signing on to the Life at Conception Act which would ban IVF nationwide as well as influential religious conservative groups declaring their opposition to it.

Republican senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama made a counter proposal with a bill that would have allowed any state to ban IVF, but would have withdrawn them from Medicaid funding if they did so.

Bernie Sanders has promised to legalize marijuana on Inauguration Day if elected. How realistic is this pledge?,"Bernie Sanders has said he will legalize marijuana on Day 1 if elected POTUS.

The executive branch does have the authority to unilaterally remove a drug from the Controlled Substances Act, but you can't get rid of those state-level prohibitions with an executive order. Ending federal weed prohibition completely legalizes the drug in those states that have already done so...but does nothing to stop an Idaho cop from arresting someone for smoking a joint in Boise.

The question of what to do about the international drug treaties also looms large. Canada and Uruguay simply flaunted the cannabis prohibitions in said treaties when they legalized, but America can't do the same thing and face the same muted reaction. America was the architect of the international drug control system, and the USA either ignoring or withdrawing from the treaties will probably collapase the whole system.

"Currently Biden is leading in every swing state, as well as several red states. What could happen between now and Election Day to reverse the polls and give Trump the lead?","Election Day (November 3) is about three and a half months away. Summer is usually the time when analysts begin making predictions about likelihood of each candidate winning.

Using RealClearPolitics as a source, [currently Joe Biden (D) is leading in every single swing state across the nation and is competitive in multiple traditionally deep-red states.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/2020_elections_electoral_college_map.html).

[Every national polling agency is also giving him a commanding lead](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html) up to double digits, including even right-leaning pollsters like Rassmussen Reports.

However, the Trump campaign has consistently pushed back against this picture with the following arguments:

- Biden's lead is a temporary bump buoyed by controversies like COVID19 and BlackLivesMatters, which are a big deal right now but will likely be subdued in the American public consciousness in a few months, as the 24 hour news cycle moves on

- Trump actually has the edge but his supporters are not accurately responding to pollsters, leading to flawed polls

- Three and a half months is still so long that it's impossible to even attempt to determine which way the wind is blowing right now. The way politics works, come October we could see Trump in fact having a double digit lead across all swing states

How should we approach this last argument in particular? Certainly there is time for the narrative to change. Realistically what kind of events would have to happen in order for the map to change 180-degrees and for Trump to lead everywhere again? Could economic recovery do this? If COVID settles down, would Biden's lead disappear? Are there any ""October surprises"" or brewing scandals that could have a major effect on the Biden campaign?

Amy Coney Barrett has just been confirmed by the Senate to become a judge on the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court now has a 6-3 conservative majority.

Barrett has caused lots of controversy throughout the country over the past month since she was nominated to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg after she passed away in mid-September. Democrats have fought to have the confirmation of a new Supreme Court Justice delayed until after the next president is sworn into office. Meanwhile Republicans were pushing her for her confirmation and hearings to be done before election day. 

Democrats were previously denied the chance to nominate a Supreme Court Justice in 2016 when the GOP-dominated Senate refused to vote on a Supreme Court judge during an election year. Democrats have said that the GOP is being hypocritical because they are holding a confirmation only a month away from the election while they were denied their pick 8 months before the election. Republicans argue that the Senate has never voted on a SCOTUS pick when the Senate and Presidency are held by different parties. 

Because of the high stakes for Democratic legislation in the future, and lots of worry over issues like healthcare and abortion, Democrats are considering several drastic measures to get back at the Republicans for this. Many have advocated to pack the Supreme Court by adding justices to create a liberal majority. Critics argue that this will just mean that when the GOP takes power again they will do the same thing. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has endorsed nor dismissed the idea of packing the courts, rather saying he would gather experts to help decide how to fix the justice system.

Other ideas include eliminating the filibuster, term limits, retirement ages, jurisdiction-stripping, and a supermajority vote requirement for SCOTUS cases.

How does the US convince people who are convinced the US Presidential election was rigged that it wasn't?,"Every state has confirmed the election results, including those in red states where Biden won. Virtually every lawsuit by Trump-associated lawyers have been struck down hard and fast.

Yet, reading conservative sources, including some here, there is a sizable population that is certain the election was stolen, as does President Trump and others in his administration. Infowars, OANN and a host of conservative websites are beating the drum of election fraud.

I try to keep an open mind, and read the claims. For example, the recent claim that ""suitcases of fake ballots in Georgia were processed after sending poll watchers home."" I read the assertions, then the 'debunking,' and while the video and theory seemed plausible at first, reading the rebuttal --including the one in Forbes-- it looked pretty clear that assertions weren't true, and the responses made more sense than the conspiracy theory. That election officials in Georgia and people in the Republican governor's administration also dismissed the charges as untrue was sufficient for me, especially since they had every reason to want to agree with charges, including considerable pressure from Trump and his supporters. But it's not sufficient proof for those who believe the election was stolen by a vast conspiracy.

I know that the initial response from most about changing these folks' minds is that, ""you can't."" But if 50M people are convinced that the election was stolen, and that our election system is corrupt and unfixable... then they believe that the only way to ""restore"" the system is through martial law and militarily-supervised elections. That's pretty much what Michael Flynn and others are saying. That can't be the only fix. And if we can't convince them otherwise, this is a ticking time bomb for any number of bad things for America.

B) economy. We’re being told the economy is doing fabulous but people are hurting. Prices are inflated and companies are price gouging. This was a much bigger issue just a couple months ago but voters are turning around on the issue. Still, if this comes back, this favors Trump. 

C) Ukraine and Gaza. Trump is a lot of things but perhaps the one thing both sides can agree on is that he’s not a war mongerer. Kamala was VP to Biden as both wars broke out under his watch. Specifically on Gaza, this has touched the Arab/muslim population as well as the young population and if even a sizable percentage of them sit out, this is a Trump win. 

D) abortion. Democrats won 2020 and stopped a red wave in 2022 on abortion. This is still very much a live issue. If this issue becomes front and center, Kamala wins. 

E) immigration. This is something Trump has been inserting into every answer, regardless of the question he is asked, and for good reason. The issue favors him. If immigration becomes the issue of the day, Trump wins. 

F) Something else. Maybe there’s another dark horse issue that’ll make a seismic impact and determine the election. What issue do you think that will be?

A US Army spokesperson has released a statement rebuking Trump over the Arlington National Cemetery altercation. What impact does this potentially play in the lead-up to the election?,"Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-army-defends-arlington-national-cemetery-employee-trump-campaign-incident-2024-08-29/

According to the source, the US Army has made a statement on the matter, considered ""rare"" by source as the Army seldom comments on political matters.

Key quotes: ""An ANC (Arlington National Cemetery) employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,"" the Army statement said.

""This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,"" it added.

1.) Trump's campaign has had a few different statements to the incident so far, one being: ""Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung had said: '""The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.'"" (Reuters)

2.) “'For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed [sic] grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces, and they are disrespecting everyone who paid the price for defending our country,' LaCivita continued."" [A statement provided to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html)

EDIT:   
  
Some people in the comments are questioning if I'm some sort of paid plant, content booster, etc. whose sole purpose is to get Kamala elected. Full disclosure, I am not. In fact, I think she is a political chameleon who says whatever she has to in the pursuit of gaining power. She lacks genuine charisma, concrete political philosophy, and is basically an empty suit pro-corporate, pro-establishment Democrat, who wants more government programs (with little concern for the national debt).   
  
Further disclosure, I used Video Summarizer by [thegeneralmind.com](http://thegeneralmind.com) to extract the closest thing to policy positions because its hard to know where Harris stands on certain things. It gets even more difficult to know because she flip-flops on issues.   
  
I believe in holding people accountable to their word no matter political affiliation. I also expect people seeking office to provide facts to support their positions. I feel like Kamala doesnt do well on this front. Our media largely fails at making this happen too, however, I've realized AI models can democratize fact checking and not only keep politicians honest but also ourselves. As an example, I've used AI to interrogate, summarize, and understand the border bill legislation because both sides are saying the bill does something different. Theres no way I would read through a bill thats hundreds of pages, with text that is often a foreign language. With AI it makes it ridiculously easy and it will only improve.

Harris won Virginia by 5.8%. Biden won it by 10% four years earlier. Could Virginia turn purple and become a competitive state within the next few election cycles?,"Harris won Virginia in 2024, but Virginia was not always a blue state. In 2000 and 2004, Bush carried it by 8%. Obama carried it by 6% and 4%. Clinton carried it by 5%, Biden carried it by 10%, and Harris carried it by 5%. Notably, the number of voters who voted for Trump increased in the last two elections. In addition, in the 2021 gubernatorial election, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe by 64k votes, or 2% of the vote. Republican Bob McDonnell also served as governor of Virginia from 2010 to 2014. I watched election night on November 5, and there were concerns that Trump might actually win Virginia until around 11PM or midnight, when Harris took the lead. Until 2016, Virginia tended to vote for the winner, but in 2016 and 2024 voted for the losing candidate. Pundits like to speculate about Florida or Texas turning blue, but, if anything, as this election has shown, it is blue states that are at risk of turning red. This begs the question: Could Virginia turn purple and become a competitive state within the next few election cycles?",168,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gzibav/harris_won_virginia_by_58_biden_won_it_by_10_four/,193,1732539765.0,Throwaway921845,Harris win Virginia 5.8 Biden win 10 year early Virginia turn purple competitive state election cycle,Harris win Virginia 2024 Virginia blue state 2000 2004 Bush carry 8 Obama carry 6 4 Clinton carry 5 Biden carry 10 Harris carry 5 notably number voter vote Trump increase election addition 2021 gubernatorial election Republican Glenn Youngkin defeat Democrat Terry McAuliffe 64k vote 2 vote republican Bob McDonnell serve governor Virginia 2010 2014 watch election night November 5 concern Trump actually win Virginia 11pm midnight Harris take lead 2016 Virginia tend vote winner 2016 2024 vote lose candidate pundit like speculate Florida Texas turn blue election show blue state risk turn red beg question Virginia turn purple competitive state election cycle
"Will Lt. Gov Robinson's ""Pizza box in the booth"" scandal cost Trump NC and as a result the 2024 election? (The guy Trump called the next MLK)","Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. 

With Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the ""private booths"" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.

 Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens ""maggots and filth"". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?

 If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.

Notable Republicans are now feuding about potential shortfalls come the November midterms. Could this lead to further segmenting and disagreements within the party before the election?,"This week has been a contentious one for the GOP, even before the surprising defeat of Sarah Palin in the AK-01 special house election.

On September 1st senator Rick Scott, chair of the GOP's Senate Campaign arm, did an exclusive interview with [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/01/rick-scott-disagreement-mitch-mcconnell-00054423) where he said \*\*“\*\**If you trash talk our candidates … you hurt our chances of winning, and you hurt our candidates’ ability to raise money,”*

While not named directly many concluded this was a direct shot at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who has gone on the record many times talking about [candidate quality](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/us/politics/mcconnell-midterm-elections.html) in this years midterms.

He also further attacked more moderate republicans by stating that *“Unfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,”*

As of now most notable republican candidates are trailing democrats in key races with Fetterman in Pennsylvania holding a clear lead against Oz and Warnock with a slight edge in Georgia.

 Is Ranked-Choice Voting a Better Alternative for U.S. Elections?,"I've been following discussions around different voting systems, and Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) keeps coming up as a potential improvement to our current system. Proponents argue that it allows for a more representative outcome, reducing the ""spoiler"" effect and encouraging more positive campaigning. On the other hand, critics claim it can be confusing for voters and may not actually solve the problems it's intended to address.

What can the US do to avoid a crisis with its November elections when the Republican party is making efforts to influence the way votes are counted and its presumptive nominee won't recognize any election that doesn't go his way?,"[Unbowed by Jan. 6 Charges, Republicans Pursue Plans to Contest a Trump Defeat](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/us/politics/republican-election-campaign-2024.html?unlocked_article_code=1.600.zC5v.KygM4IiyOei5): Mr. Trump’s allies are preparing to try to short-circuit the election system, if he does not win.



A recent New York Times article says: 


> The Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system. Their wide-ranging and methodical effort is laying the groundwork to contest an election that they argue, falsely, is already being rigged against former President Donald J. Trump.


> The campaign involves a powerful network of Republican lawyers and activist groups, working loosely in concert with the Republican National Committee. Many of the key players were active in Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.


> But unlike the chaotic and improvised challenge four years ago, the new drive includes a systematic search for any vulnerability in the nation’s patchwork election system.


> Mr. Trump’s allies have followed a two-pronged approach: restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and short-circuiting the process of ratifying the winner afterward, if Mr. Trump loses. The latter strategy involves an ambitious — and legally dubious — attempt to reimagine decades of settled law dictating how results are officially certified in the weeks before the transfer of power.


Across the country, elections workers and officials have been experiencing increasing harassment and abuse:


> More than a third of surveyed local election officials have experienced threats, harassment or abuse due to their jobs, according to a new poll released Wednesday.


> The 38 percent of local election officials who reported mistreatment in the poll from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law marks an 8 percentage point uptick from the survey’s 2023 edition. The most common manner of receiving these threats occurred in person or over the phone.


> Poll workers and their colleagues aren’t only worried about themselves — about a quarter of those surveyed said they’re concerned about their family or loved ones receiving threats or harassment in future elections.


> In response to safety concerns, local election officials are leaving their jobs. Twenty-seven percent of respondents said they know one or two local election officials who have resigned over concerns about their well-being, almost a 10 percentage point increase from the 18 percent who said the same in 2023.


....


> Sixty-two percent of respondents also voiced concerns about political leaders engaging in efforts to interfere in how election officials do their jobs.

What is the likely outcome of the 2026 US Senate elections?,"The 2024 US Senate election was highly unfavourable for Democrats as they lost 3 seats (Montana, Ohio and West Virginia) and are likely to lose another in Pennsylvania depending on recounts. Therefore, they will have 47 seats (including Sanders and King) to the Republicans 53 seats in the next Congress. So they will need a net gain at least 4 seats in 2026 to become the majority party.

The 2026 US Senate map is much more favourable to Democrats compared to 2024. In 2026, only 13 Democratic held seats up for election compared to 20 for Republicans (22 if you include JD Vance’s Ohio seat and Marco Rubio’s Florida seat). In addition, the 2026 election cycle is a during a midterm election hence the opposing party to the president usually performs well.

Most seats up for election are uncompetitive so the Republicans should retain: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida (special election - Rubio’s seat), Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. This leaves them on 49 seats.

Likewise the Democrats should retain: Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Virginia. This leaves them on 45 seats.

Therefore, there are 6 seats up for grabs including: Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio (special election - JD Vance’s seat). Democrats need to win all 6 just to get a majority which is challenging.

Georgia and Michigan are likely to remain Democratic. North Carolina has the potential to flip to the Democrats and they have ran close in the last few elections. Maine should be an easy Democratic win is complicated by the fact that Susan Collins is running for re-election and is popular in their state. Iowa is difficult and could only be flipped in a blue wave election. Ohio is trending Republican but if Sherod Brown stands, the Democrats have a chance to flip the state. Brown outperformed Harris in this state this cycle.

So what is the likely outcome of the 2026 US Senate elections? Do Democrats have a chance to gain seats and potentially flip control of the chamber?

"The Supreme Court heard arguments today [4/25/24] about Trump's immunity claim on whether he can be prosecuted for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 U.S. Elections. Can a former president be prosecuted for alleged crimes while in office [absent a prior impeachment, conviction and removal]?   ","Attorneys for former President Trump argued that he is immune from criminal prosecution for actions he took while in office \[official acts\]. The lawyers maintained, that had he been impeached and convicted while in office; he could have been subsequently prosecuted upon leaving office. \[He was impeached, but never convicted\]. 

They also argued that there is no precedent of prosecuting a former president for acts while in office as evidence that immunity attaches to all acts while in office. Trump also claims that the steps he took to block the certification of Joe Biden's election were part of his official duties and that he thus cannot be criminally prosecuted. 

Trump's attorneys wrote in their opening brief to the high court. ""The President cannot function, and the Presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the President faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office..."" 

Earlier in February 2024, however, a unanimous panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the former president's argument that he has ""absolute immunity"" from prosecution for acts performed while in office. 

""Presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that, as to the president, the Congress could not legislate, the executive could not prosecute and the judiciary could not review,"" the judges ruled. ""We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.""

Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump on four counts related to his attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020, argued: “Presidents are not above the law.” Earlier, the District court had similarly reasoned.  

Arguments by prosecution also noted that impeachment, conviction and removal is a political remedy distinguishing it from judicial accountability. And that the latter \[criminal prosecution\] is not dependent on what does or does not happen during impeachment.  They noted as well illustrating a distinction between official and unofficial acts, giving an example that creating fraudulent electors for certification are not official acts...   

Constitutional law experts overwhelmingly side with Smith. Many reject the claim by Trump's that no president can be prosecuted unless he has been first been impeached, convicted and removed from office, they call that argument ""preposterous."" 

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had similarly rejected that idea when he voted against conviction in the second Trump impeachment. ""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We have a criminal justice system in this country ... and former presidents are not immune.""

I'm a registered Democrat and I'm voting for Trump this election,"I live in a very liberal state and have historically voted Democrat. However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:

1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.

2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.

3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.

4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.

5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn’t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she’s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.

While I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I’m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I’m voting for Trump. 

Let’s all make our voices heard and vote!

You were cheated out of a free and fair democratic election. Everyday up until election day.,"While there is no significant evidence they have cheated at the ballot box. 

Yes. You were cheated out of a free and fair democratic election.

Instead of participating in an election to continue the American experiment of democracy, they ran a tyrant. With that intent, they broke the social contract that is our constitution.

Their senators, violated their oaths in the January 6th impeachment trial, where Trump should have been disqualified from re-election. 

Their corrupt judges allowed Trump to escape prosecution, and continue to be on the ballot. 

Trump and his advocates weaponized rhetoric to radicalize citizens against democracy. To spread so much misinformation, that millions of other voters made falsely informed decisions in the election. 

So after the election, Biden was wrong when he told us we should accept the election results, because ""You can't love your country only when you win.""

Because if you love your country, if you are a patriot, you should feel cheated. You should feel angry, about everything that led up to election day. 

Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't entitled to be furious that Republicans misused the Constitution and our system of laws to establish themselves an authoritarian government. Your country has been stolen from you. 

However, save that rage for where it matters. There is no evidence so far of voting shenanigans. And you're going to need to use that anger to resist the next stages of authoritarian takeover.

I will be switching my vote to Donald Trump this election,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been here a little bit in the past but just wanted to say I am proud to say I am voting Trump this November. 

I decided this about a month or so ago. I’ve usually voted 3rd party/libertarian candidates in the past, I voted Jo Jorgensen in 2020 and realized that this is not doing me or our country any good. As much as RFK Jr could be a good candidate he’s not going to win more than likely. 

I grew up in the south, have lived in liberal cities, lived in red states and blue states, currently live in a liberal city. I’ve noticed that Biden/Harris don’t care about helping build up lower income communities and instead it’s all about hand outs, it’s not about building them up as people, giving them places to work, job skills, and helping get people on their feet. It’s about keeping them down so they rely on them and will vote for them every election cycle, but the kicker is every 3/3.5 years is when democrats rediscover these communities and pander to them. I’m sick and tired of seeing it as someone who lives near these communities. I want to see these people grow and flourish and make something of themselves, but instead I see the people who are actually getting legit help from the government are not even legal citizens here as we saw in Chicago/New York/Texas/California.

I’m tired of the democrats only caring about people specifically every election cycle and getting hardly anything done in between. 

In terms of Trump, while he’s not my favorite person, I think he’s better than Kamala Harris. I feel that his policies will help the population far more than Kamala Harris.

With Trumps legal history that we all know about, I think the justice system is highly against him for political reasons, I think he’s a manufactured felon and not an actual felon, I think Alvin Bragg and the DOJ took a weird misdemeanor and bumped it up to 34 felony counts. This is the same DA in NYC who’s taken violent felons and lowered them to misdemeanors. I believe he is being weaponized and it’s all to keep him out of office and I can see right through that and I hope you all can as well.

Joe Biden has taken classified information and been given a slap on the wrist, Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence and was given a slap on the wrist. I think Trump can be given a slap on the wrist and given a pass like the other 2.

I also don’t believe the whole project 2025 narrative they’re trying to create, this is a foundation that’s been trying to push a hard right agenda for decades and they’ve never been successful and they’re not going to be successful with Trump now. Pay attention to his offical agenda, Agenda47.

When there was the assassination attempt, I saw Trump put his fist in the air and tell people to fight for what they believe in, and I think we should fight for a better America for all Americans.

At the end of the day, I do not want a SF progressive as a president. I think Trump will be better at keeping us safe, helping our economy grow, bringing higher wages back to our workers in this country, and helping get the US back to where it belongs. He’ll be better for all groups of people and help everyone grow consistently. I think Trumps strong stances are what we need for the country and that’s a strong border, strong economy, ending wars overseas and negotiating peace deals. I believe he will win but keep spreading the word. 


Btw, my family all live in a very competitive swing state and I am making sure they vote Trump as well. 

Thank you all for reading.


P.S I hope this post changes your mind too, if this post has inspired you please message me! I’m hoping to change at least one persons mind to vote the other way!",659,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/1eb67l0/i_will_be_switching_my_vote_to_donald_trump_this/,220,1721839579.0,Dope_Reddit_Guy,switch vote Donald Trump election,"hi

Can someone please explain why this election season is so bad?,"I (17y f) am not eligible to vote. However I just had a recommendation post on my feed with someone scratching a car to get a Trump sticker off. I don’t know my political party but I do have basic manners and respect. However, it was a progressive place and I went there to get educated and said it was a bad election season and they went full out. I even stopped interacting because they’re confusing. So if someone can please explain as to why we like Trump or Kamala I’d be happy to learn. I wanna keep an open mind for future elections considering I’m missing this one. Usually I do not worry about politics because I cant vote so theres no need. I did research on Trump and Obama and Joe. Joe was a sad case for me. I only found  good things about Trump though that are actually true because it goes back to the 1980’s and 90’s.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.

Illegally appointed partisan prosecutor Jack Smith indicts Trump a second time for January 6 issues today. This is blatant and clear election interference.,"No doubt Harris and Biden ordered this second indictment related to January 6. U.S. House Republicans can not allow Democrats to steal the 2024 election because that's what they're trying to do. Jack Smith is a partisan SOB Democrat and wants to keep Trump from running, his wife even works for the DNC. Smith was illegally appointed and the courts need to remove him from these criminal cases against Trump. Time to investigate all these partisan fake judges as well for election interference: Juan Merchan in New York, Tanya Chutkan.
